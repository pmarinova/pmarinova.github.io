Hi there!

This is my personal blog which I've created mostly for me, to keep a diary of the various technical problems I face in my hobby projects.

Why? Because I like writing and because I'd like to challenge myself to share this stuff publicly without overthinking it too much. I tend to be more on the perfectionist side, which sometimes keeps me from making progress and leaves me with a ton of unfinished ideas ðŸ˜ƒ

Often when I struggle to get something to work I find the answer in a random blog post. Who knows, maybe someone else will find their answer here...
